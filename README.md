# Git and GitHub Project

This repository demonstrates an assignment for basic Git and GitHub operations  for my Software engineering study. 
It covers essential Git tasks such as creating a repository, staging and committing files, managing changes, and configuring Git settings. 
The project includes a **`git.tex`** file and a **PDF** document explaining these steps in detail.
